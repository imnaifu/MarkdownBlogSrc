The brain creates thoughts the same way we learn language:
by mixing and matching letters to form words, then mixing and matching words to explain ourselves.
The brain mixes and matches bits of memory to form ideas, and everything ever imagined.
It's a closed, and automatic system. What people call the conscious mind is just a series of thoughts.
We, as these thoughts, have absolutely no influence on the making of these conscious thoughts.
Free will is an illusion. 1st clue - A MRI study on decision making: 
The older part of the brain makes decisions seconds before the conscious mind.
How? 2nd clue - Why don't we eat our favorite food at every meal? 
Because its emotional value changes over time, as do most things in life.
My theory: Every little piece of memory is tagged with just a bit either positive or negative emotion. 
The brain merely adds up the pluses and minuses for every possible choice, and then picks the best one.
3rd clue - Every living thing with a brain must be able to react to a life and death situation,
when there's no time to think. Basically, we're organic robots, programmed by DNA, and the environment.
It's likely true of all life. For abstract thinking? Ask un-obvious questions, and then seek answers.
Repetition trains and conditions the brain. If your brain doesn't know an answer, 
it will mix and match bits until it's tried every possible combination. Upgrade the material your brain consumes.
